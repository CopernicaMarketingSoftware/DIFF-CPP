# DIFF-CPP

This is a library to calculate diffs and patches. This is probably a stupid idea, but in this repository we store
an attempt to refactor the [diff-match-patch library by Google](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch), because
that library relies on Qt, which we do not use at Copernica., and we would like to have UTF8 support too. Anyway, 
**this library does not yet work, so better not use it!**
